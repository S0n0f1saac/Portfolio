This project leverages computer vision to extract meaningful data from soccer games and utilizes machine learning (ML) models to analyze that data. 
The goal is to develop an automated system that can process video footage, detect key game events, and generate insights to enhance performance analysis, strategic planning, and decision-making in soccer.
This folder contains a collection of .ipynb and .py files as well as a written report on my findings.
