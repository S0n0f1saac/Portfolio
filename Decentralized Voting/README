The goal of this project is to develop a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting system using blockchain technology. This system will allow users to cast votes in a decentralized manner, ensuring fairness and eliminating the risks of manipulation or fraud. 

The key objectives include:

Immutability: Votes cannot be altered once cast.

Security: Only authorized voters can participate.

Transparency: Election results are verifiable by anyone.

Ease of Use: Simple user interface for voters to cast and verify votes.

The project consists of the following main files:

1. Smart Contract Files (.sol) 
2. Deployment & Testing (.js) 
3. Configuration & Dependencies (.js) (.env)
4. Frontend Files (.html) (.js) (.css)

There is also a written report on the efficacy of smart contracts in voting systems.
